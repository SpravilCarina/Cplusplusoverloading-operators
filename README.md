Project Overview:
This C++ project demonstrates the implementation of operator overloading to enhance the functionality and readability of custom classes. Operator overloading allows custom classes to use standard operators (e.g., +, -, *, etc.) in a way that is intuitive and consistent with built-in types.
Key Features:
Operator Overloading:
Arithmetic Operators: Overloaded operators such as +, -, *, and / to perform arithmetic operations on custom class objects.
Comparison Operators: Implemented operators like ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= to compare objects of the custom class.
Assignment Operator: Defined the = operator to handle object assignments and ensure deep copying of data.
Stream Insertion and Extraction: Overloaded << and >> operators for easy input and output of custom class objects.
Custom Class Examples:
Created examples of custom classes where operator overloading provides meaningful operations, such as mathematical computations or comparisons.
Usage:
Arithmetic Operations: Perform calculations using +, -, *, / directly on class instances.
Comparison: Use comparison operators to evaluate relationships between objects.
Stream Operations: Utilize << and >> to interact with objects through standard input and output streams.
How to Run:
Compile the Code:
Use a C++ compiler to compile the source files. Example command: g++ -o my_program main.cpp.
Execute the Program:
Run the compiled executable. Example command: ./my_program.
Interact with the Program:
Follow the prompts to test various operations defined by overloaded operators in your custom classes.
Dependencies:
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
Standard C++ Library
